This project can be used as a starting point to create your own Vaadin application.
It has the necessary dependencies and files to help you get started.

The best way to use it is via [vaadin.com/start](https://vaadin.com/start) - you can get only the necessary parts and choose the package naming you want to use.
There is also a [getting started tutorial](https://vaadin.com/learn) based on this project.

To access it directly from github, clone the repository and import the project to the IDE of your choice as a Maven project. You need to have Java 8 or 11 installed.

Run using `mvn jetty:run` and open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in the browser.

If you want to run your app locally in the production mode, run `mvn jetty:run -Pproduction`.
