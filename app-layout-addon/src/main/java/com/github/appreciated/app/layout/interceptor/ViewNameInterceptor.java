 * The ViewNameInterceptor ist meant to be used to change the paths before they are added to the router / Navigator.

 * name the paths for you. Usually the captions of the buttons are being used, which in some cases might bear the
 * problem of invalid url encoding.
 *
 * A example implementation can be found #{@see com.github.appreciated.app.layout.interceptor.DefaultViewNameInterceptor}
